This will be a day where you accomplish (or at least attempt) a ton! Take it easy, be patient with yourself and talk with your partner. It’s ok if you find it challenging – even very challenging. Just help me understand what you need help understanding…
1.	Find a programming partner and log on.
2.	Create an account for yourself on GitHub (github.com). GitHub is a “social networking site” for programmers.
3.	Send me an e-mail (douglas.urner@highlineschools.org) with your username.
4.	Create a new Repository (aka repo) and give it a name you like – I called mine HTML101.
5.	Give it a description of some sort (this will become the README file), check the “initialize repository” box, and then click on the green Create Repository button at the bottom.
6.	Note the “HTTPS clone URL” box on the right hand side of the window – you’ll want it later.
7.	Start up the program Terminal.
8.	Go to your home directory (type the command cd).
9.	Make a new directory called “Source” (mkdir Source).
10.	Go there (cd Source).
11.	Go back to the GitHub window in your browser and get a copy of the URL (type Command-C or use the clipboard button).
12.	Get a clone of your repository (git clone Command-V). Typing Command-V pastes the URL you just copied. When you hit enter magic happens and you get a copy of the files from GitHub.
13.	Use the ls command, and ls –l to see what just happened.
14.	Now take some time to make peace with a text editor. This part will take some time, but you need to be able to create a “plain text” file and programs like Word can’t do that without a lot of griping… There are several, in rough order of pain (and power):
a.	TextEdit
b.	PhpStorm
c.	vi
d.	emacs
15.	The things you have to be able to do right now are create a new file, type some text into it and save it. The rest comes later…
16.	Go to the tutorial at: http://htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner and get started.
17.	Add your file to git (git add file-name).
18.	After each step commit (git commit –a –m “name of step here”), and then push (git push) your changes. The first time you push you’ll be asked for your username and password.
If you get to here you are amazing and have accomplished a ton!
