# HTML101

Learn the basics of HTML markup and the big ideas that go into organizing online
content. When you are done you should be able to construct a functional, if not
elegant HTML page.

### What I want you to come away with is:

1. Understanding the structure (syntax) of an HTML file.
1. Understanding the separation between content, presentation (appearance), and
behavior – "who" is responsible for each function and why is the separation
important.
1. Understanding what is meant by "markup" and specifically "semantic markup."
1. Know how to use HTML tags to markup document elements.
1. Knowing how to create a "well formed" HTML file.
1. Create HTML content to match the markup of a simple wireframe.

## What you're expected to know and be able to do:

### Vocabulary & Terms

* attribute
* character encoding
* comment
* doctype
* element
* HTML
* HTTP
* index.html
* markup
* semantic markup
* syntax
* tag

### Skills

* Explain the syntactic structure of an HTML document.
* Create the skeleton of a valid HTML5 document with all required HTML elements.
* Create links to other HTML documents.
* Add images to an HTML document.
* Create lists.
* Create tables.
* Explain what is meant by the term "semantic markup."
* Explain the purpose of the ```<div>``` and ```<span>``` tags.
* Add comments to an HTML document.

## Things To Try

1. The HTML Dog [HTML Beginner Tutorial](http://htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner)
is an excellent introduction to HTML. Working through it will take you two or
three class periods. Commit your changes to git at the end of each day.
1. HTML Validators are online tools that check for errors in your coding. The
code from the HTML Dog tutorial isn't perfect. Do a search on the terms "html
validator" and try validating your code from the tutorial on several of the top
ranked validators. Correct all of the errors and warnings and commit them to git.


## How To Show That You've Got It:

The evidence that you've got the basics of HTML will be a valid and
well-structured HTML file that you can use as a template when creating other HTML
documents. Your template should reflect your knowledge of semantic markup and
include comments to remind you of the details of how it works. Since it's purpose
is to be a foundation for future work it must validate perfectly.

If you are using a fancy IDE like Sublime Text or PhpStorm you may choose to
create templates and snippets for the IDE instead of the template file.

So, do this:

1. Create an HTML101 repository on GitHub.
1. Create your template and check it in to the repository.
1. Validate the HTML and make any changes needed.
1. Update the repository to reflect your changes.

  as page layout devices. That is evil, if you see examples or tutorials that
  recommend it, shake your head wisely and move along. On the other hand there
  are still lots of valid uses for HTML tables, they are essential for presenting
  tabular data. Just don't use them for page layout…
