# HTML101

Learn the basics of HTML markup and the big ideas that go into organizing online
content.

### What I want you to come away with is:

1. Understanding the structure (syntax) of an HTML file.
1. Understanding the separation between content, presentation (appearance), and
behavior – "who" is responsible for each function and why is the separation
important.
1. Understanding what is meant by "markup" and specifically "semantic markup."
1. Know how to use HTML tags to markup document elements.
1. Knowing how to create a "well formed" HTML file.
1. Create HTML content to match the markup of a simple wireframe.

## What you're expected to know and be able to do:

### Vocabulary & Terms

* attribute
* character encoding
* comment
* doctype
* element
* HTML
* HTTP
* index.html
* markup
* semantic markup
* syntax
* tag

### Skills

* Explain the syntactic structure of an HTML document.
* Create the skeleton of a valid HTML5 document with all required HTML elements.
* Create links to other HTML documents.
* Add images to an HTML document.
* Create lists.
* Create tables.
* Explain what is meant by the term "semantic markup."
* Explain the purpose of the ```<div>``` and ```<span>``` tags.
* Add comments to an HTML document.

## Things To Try

1. Go to the tutorial at: http://htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner and get started.


## How To Show That You've Got It:

The evidence that you've got the basics of HTML will be a valid and
well-structured HTML file that you can use as a template when creating other HTML
documents. Your template should reflect your knowledge of semantic markup and
include comments to remind you of the details of how it works. Since it's purpose
is to be a foundation for future work it must validate perfectly.

If you are using a fancy IDE like Sublime Text or PhpStorm you may choose to
create templates and snippets for the IDE instead of the template file.

So, do this:

1. Create an HTML101 repository on GitHub.
1. Create your template and check it in to the repository.
1. Validate the HTML and make any changes needed.
1. Update the repository to reflect your changes.
